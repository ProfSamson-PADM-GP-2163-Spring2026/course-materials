**Course:** Labor Policy and the Future of Work
**Connects to:** Week 2 - Labor Market Dynamics
**Due Date:** [To be determined]
**Points:** 50

---

## Overview

This assignment introduces you to the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, the most accessible source of U.S. economic data. You'll explore labor market indicators, create visualizations, and practice interpreting economic trends. **No coding or statistical software is required** - FRED's web interface handles everything.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. Navigate and search the FRED database effectively
2. Create and customize economic data visualizations
3. Identify business cycle patterns in labor market data
4. Connect data trends to real-world events and policy changes
5. Communicate economic findings clearly in writing

## Part 1: Getting Started with FRED (10 points)

### Task 1.1: Create Your FRED Account

1. Go to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/
2. Click "My Account" and create a free account
3. This allows you to save graphs and create dashboards

### Task 1.2: Find and Graph the Unemployment Rate

1. Search for "unemployment rate" in the FRED search bar
2. Select **UNRATE** (Civilian Unemployment Rate)
3. Click "Edit Graph" and set the date range to **2000-01-01 to present**
4. Download or screenshot your graph

**Deliverable:** Your unemployment rate graph (2000-present)

### Task 1.3: Short Answer (1 paragraph)

Looking at your graph, identify:
- The two major spikes in unemployment (what years?)
- Which spike was larger?
- How long did it take for unemployment to return to pre-spike levels in each case?

---

## Part 2: Comparing Labor Market Indicators (20 points)

### Task 2.1: Create a Multi-Series Graph

Using FRED's "Edit Graph" → "Add Line" feature, create a single graph showing **three series** from 2007 to present:

1. **Unemployment Rate** (UNRATE)
2. **Labor Force Participation Rate** (CIVPART)
3. **Employment-Population Ratio** (EMRATIO)

**Tips:**
- Use "Format" to change colors so lines are distinguishable
- Add a second Y-axis if scales are very different
- Add recession shading (Edit Graph → Add Recession Bars)

**Deliverable:** Your three-series graph with recession shading

### Task 2.2: Analysis Questions (1-2 paragraphs each)

Answer the following questions based on your graph:

**Question A:** During the 2008-2009 recession, all three indicators worsened. But did they recover at the same pace afterward? Which recovered fastest? Which took longest? Why might this be?

**Question B:** Look at the COVID-19 shock (March 2020). How was it different from the 2008 recession in terms of:
- Speed of the decline
- Depth of the decline
- Speed of the recovery

**Question C:** The labor force participation rate has never fully recovered to its pre-2008 level. Propose two possible explanations for this long-term decline. (Think about demographics, discouraged workers, disability, education, etc.)

## Part 3: Wages and Inflation (15 points)

### Task 3.1: Create a Wage Growth Graph

Create a graph showing:
1. **Average Hourly Earnings, Total Private** (CES0500000003) - set units to "Percent Change from Year Ago"

Set date range: 2015 to present

**Deliverable:** Your wage growth graph

### Task 3.2: Add Inflation for Comparison

On the same graph, add:
2. **Consumer Price Index** (CPIAUCSL) - also set to "Percent Change from Year Ago"

**Deliverable:** Your wage growth vs. inflation graph

### Task 3.3: Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)

**Question:** When wage growth exceeds inflation, workers' purchasing power increases ("real wages" rise). When inflation exceeds wage growth, purchasing power falls.

Looking at your graph:
- During what periods did real wages rise (wage growth > inflation)?
- During what periods did real wages fall?
- What happened in 2021-2022? How might this have affected workers' attitudes toward their jobs?

---

## Part 4: Reflection and Connection to Course Themes (5 points)

### Short Essay (Half page, ~250 words)

Based on your exploration of FRED data, write a short reflection addressing:

1. **One thing that surprised you** in the data. What pattern or trend did you not expect to see?

2. **One policy question** that the data raises for you. For example: "Why hasn't the labor force participation rate recovered?" or "What could policy do about the 2021-2022 inflation surge?"

3. **Limitations:** What can't you learn from aggregate national data like this? What additional data would help you understand labor markets better?

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Part 1: Unemployment graph + analysis | 10 | Correct graph, accurate identification of spikes and recovery times |
| Part 2: Multi-series graph | 8 | All three series included, recession bars, readable formatting |
| Part 2: Analysis questions | 12 | Thoughtful responses with specific references to data |
| Part 3: Wage/inflation graph | 7 | Both series included, correct transformation to % change |
| Part 3: Analysis | 8 | Correctly identifies real wage changes, connects to worker experience |
| Part 4: Reflection | 5 | Genuine engagement, identifies meaningful question |
| **Total** | **50** | |

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Explore FRED's features** - Try different graph types, date ranges, and transformations
2. **Use specific numbers** - Don't just say "unemployment rose" - say "unemployment rose from 4.7% to 10%"
3. **Think about causation** - What events might have caused the patterns you observe?
4. **Save your work** - FRED lets you save graphs to your account; do this before closing your browser

## Checkpoint Requirement

**Before the final due date, you must show your Part 2 graph to the instructor or TA during office hours or in class.** This brief check-in (2-3 minutes) ensures you're on track and gives you a chance to ask questions. Sign-up sheet will be posted on [course LMS].
