# Assignment 6: The Future of Work - Capstone Policy Analysis

**Course:** Labor Policy and the Future of Work
**Connects to:** Weeks 12-14 - Synthesis and Policy Futures
**Due Date:** [Final exam period]
**Points:** 100

---

## Overview

This capstone assignment asks you to synthesize what you've learned throughout the course. You will analyze which workers and occupations face the greatest risks from automation and AI, and develop a comprehensive policy response.

This is the most substantial assignment of the course, bringing together data interpretation, policy analysis, and your own policy judgment.

**All data is provided** - your focus is on interpretation, synthesis, and policy design.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. Synthesize multiple course themes (technology, inequality, institutions, policy)
2. Analyze automation exposure data to identify at-risk workers
3. Evaluate multiple policy approaches to workforce disruption
4. Develop and defend a coherent policy recommendation
5. Communicate complex analysis to a general policy audience

## The Data

Download from [course LMS]: **`automation_exposure_data.xlsx`**

This workbook contains three sheets:

### Sheet 1: Occupation-Level Data
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `occ_code` | Standard Occupation Classification code |
| `occ_title` | Occupation name |
| `employment_2023` | Total employment (thousands) |
| `median_wage` | Median annual wage |
| `routine_task_index` | RTI score (higher = more routine, more automatable) |
| `ai_exposure` | AI exposure score from Felten et al. (higher = more exposed to AI) |
| `education_typical` | Typical education requirement |
| `projected_growth` | BLS projected % growth 2023-2033 |

### Sheet 2: Worker Demographics by Automation Risk
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `risk_category` | High/Medium/Low automation risk |
| `total_workers` | Number of workers (millions) |
| `pct_female` | % female |
| `pct_black` | % Black |
| `pct_hispanic` | % Hispanic |
| `pct_no_college` | % without bachelor's degree |
| `median_age` | Median age |
| `median_wage` | Median hourly wage |

### Sheet 3: Historical Job Polarization
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `year` | Year |
| `share_low_skill` | Employment share in low-skill occupations |
| `share_middle_skill` | Employment share in middle-skill occupations |
| `share_high_skill` | Employment share in high-skill occupations |

---

## Part 1: Understanding Automation Exposure (20 points)

### Task 1.1: High-Risk Occupations

Using Sheet 1, identify the **10 occupations with the highest routine task index (RTI)** that also have at least 100,000 workers.

Create a table:

| Rank | Occupation | Employment | Median Wage | RTI Score | Education Required |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| ... | | | | | |
| 10 | | | | | |

### Task 1.2: AI Exposure vs. Traditional Automation

The RTI captures "traditional" automation (robots replacing routine tasks). The AI exposure score captures new risks from machine learning and language models.

Using the data, answer:
- Are RTI and AI exposure correlated? (Do the same occupations score high on both?)
- Identify 2-3 occupations that are high on RTI but low on AI exposure
- Identify 2-3 occupations that are low on RTI but high on AI exposure
- What does this tell us about how AI is different from previous waves of automation?

### Task 1.3: Job Polarization Trends (Graph)

Using Sheet 3, create a **line graph** showing employment shares over time for low-skill, middle-skill, and high-skill occupations.

Answer: Does the data show evidence of job polarization (declining middle)? When did this trend begin or accelerate?

---

## Part 2: Who's at Risk? (20 points)

### Task 2.1: Demographic Analysis

Using Sheet 2, compare workers in high-risk vs. low-risk occupations:

| Characteristic | High-Risk Workers | Low-Risk Workers | Difference |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| % without college degree | | | |
| % female | | | |
| % Black or Hispanic | | | |
| Median age | | | |
| Median wage | | | |

### Task 2.2: Interpretation (1 page)

Based on your analysis, answer:

**A.** Which demographic groups are most concentrated in high-automation-risk occupations? Why might this be?

**B.** The median age of high-risk workers matters for policy. Are at-risk workers mostly young (easier to retrain) or older (harder to transition)?

**C.** Workers in high-risk occupations already have lower wages. What does this suggest about the distributional consequences of automation - will it increase or decrease inequality?

**D.** A policy that helps all "high-risk workers" equally would disproportionately help which groups? Is this a feature or a bug of universal vs. targeted policies?

---

## Part 3: Policy Options Analysis (25 points)

You've been asked to advise the next administration on workforce policy for the AI era. Consider the following policy options:

### Option A: Expanded Job Training
- Federal investment in community college and workforce development programs
- Focus on "automation-resistant" skills (healthcare, skilled trades, technology)
- Individual training accounts for displaced workers

### Option B: Wage Insurance and Transition Support
- Workers who lose jobs to automation receive partial wage replacement for 2 years
- Covers difference between old and new wage (up to 50%)
- Funded by employer tax on automation

### Option C: Universal Basic Income (UBI)
- $1,000/month to all adults regardless of work status
- Replaces some existing means-tested programs
- Funded by carbon tax or tech company taxes

### Option D: Sectoral Bargaining and Labor Standards
- Strengthen worker power through expanded collective bargaining
- Require advance notice and negotiation before automation
- Portable benefits for gig and contract workers

### Task 3.1: Policy Comparison Table

For each option, assess (1-2 sentences per cell):

| Criteria | Option A: Training | Option B: Wage Insurance | Option C: UBI | Option D: Labor Standards |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Who benefits most? | | | | |
| Who benefits least? | | | | |
| Main advantage | | | | |
| Main disadvantage | | | | |
| Evidence of effectiveness | | | | |
| Political feasibility | | | | |

### Task 3.2: Deep Dive on Two Options (1.5 pages)

Select **two options** and write a more detailed analysis of each:
- What does research evidence say about effectiveness?
- What are the implementation challenges?
- How would you design it to maximize impact?
- What are the strongest objections, and how would you respond?

Cite at least **one course reading or study** for each option.

## Course Themes to Integrate

Your analysis should draw on concepts from throughout the course:

- **Labor market dynamics** (Weeks 2-3): How do workers transition between jobs?
- **Wage determination** (Weeks 4-5): Why do some workers earn more? How is this changing?
- **Minimum wage and institutions** (Week 6): Role of policy in shaping outcomes
- **Technology and automation** (Weeks 8-9): Task framework, job polarization
- **Immigration** (Week 10): Labor supply effects, complementarities
- **Unions and collective bargaining** (Week 11): Worker power
- **Policy design** (Weeks 12-13): What makes policies effective?

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with the data** - Let the patterns guide your analysis, not preconceptions
2. **Be realistic about tradeoffs** - Every policy has costs and limitations
3. **Ground claims in evidence** - Don't assert things you can't back up
4. **Think about implementation** - A good idea poorly implemented is a bad policy
5. **Consider political economy** - What can actually pass?
6. **Prepare for questions** - Anticipate objections and have responses ready
