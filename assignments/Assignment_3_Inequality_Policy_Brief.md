# Assignment 3: Wage Inequality Policy Brief

**Course:** Labor Policy and the Future of Work
**Connects to:** Weeks 4-5 - Wage Determination and Inequality
**Due Date:** [To be determined]
**Points:** 75

---

## Overview

This assignment develops your policy writing skills. You will analyze **pre-made figures and tables** on U.S. wage inequality and write a policy brief recommending workforce investment priorities. The focus is on **interpretation and communication**, not data analysis.

All data visualizations are provided - your job is to understand them, extract insights, and communicate effectively to a policy audience.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. Interpret wage inequality statistics (percentile ratios, college premium, gender gap)
2. Connect empirical patterns to economic theories of wage determination
3. Write clear, evidence-based policy analysis for non-specialist audiences
4. Make defensible policy recommendations grounded in data
5. Practice professional memo writing for government/nonprofit settings

## The Evidence Package

Download from [course LMS]: **`inequality_evidence_package.pdf`**

This package contains five exhibits prepared from Current Population Survey data:

### Exhibit 1: Wage Inequality Over Time (1980-2023)
- Line graph showing 90/50 ratio and 50/10 ratio of hourly wages
- Shows "upper-tail" vs. "lower-tail" inequality trends

### Exhibit 2: College Wage Premium
- Line graph showing ratio of median wages for college graduates vs. high school graduates
- Separate lines for men and women

### Exhibit 3: Gender Wage Gap
- Line graph showing women's median hourly wage as % of men's
- Separate lines by education level

### Exhibit 4: Wage Distribution Summary (2023)
- Table showing median wages, 10th percentile, 90th percentile by demographic group
- Groups: All workers, by gender, by race/ethnicity, by education

### Exhibit 5: Regression Results
- Table showing returns to education, experience, and demographic wage gaps
- Simplified version: just coefficients and what they mean (no standard errors to interpret)

## Part 1: Evidence Interpretation (25 points)

Answer the following questions based on the exhibits. Each response should be **1 paragraph** (4-6 sentences) with specific numbers from the data.

### Question 1: Upper-Tail vs. Lower-Tail Inequality (Exhibit 1)

The 90/50 ratio measures inequality between the top and the middle; the 50/10 ratio measures inequality between the middle and the bottom.

- Which type of inequality increased more from 1980 to 2023?
- What does this tell us about where wage gains have been concentrated?
- How might this pattern relate to the "hollowing out" of middle-class jobs?

### Question 2: The College Premium (Exhibit 2)

- By how much do college graduates out-earn high school graduates in 2023 (approximately)?
- Has the college premium been growing, stable, or declining in recent years?
- Why might the premium have changed over time? (Consider supply of college graduates, demand for skills, globalization, technology)

### Question 3: The Gender Gap (Exhibit 3)

- What is the current female-to-male wage ratio (approximately)?
- Has the gender gap narrowed more for college-educated women or non-college women?
- What might explain why convergence has slowed or stalled since 2000?

### Question 4: Who's at the Bottom? (Exhibit 4)

- Which demographic groups have the lowest median wages?
- Which groups have the largest gap between 10th percentile and median wages (most inequality within the group)?
- What policy implications does this suggest for targeting interventions?

### Question 5: What Explains Wage Gaps? (Exhibit 5)

The regression shows how much of the wage gap between groups is "explained" by education and occupation vs. "unexplained" (same credentials but different pay).

- How much of the gender wage gap remains after controlling for education and occupation?
- What might the "unexplained" portion represent? (Discrimination? Unmeasured skills? Negotiation differences?)

## Part 2: Policy Brief (50 points)

Write a **4-page policy brief** recommending workforce investment priorities to address wage inequality.

### Scenario

You are a policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute (a labor-focused think tank). The incoming Secretary of Labor has requested a brief on workforce development priorities. She wants to know: **Given patterns in wage inequality, where should the Department of Labor focus its limited resources?**

### Required Sections

**1. Executive Summary (half page)**
- 3-4 bullet points summarizing key findings and recommendations
- A busy Secretary should be able to read only this section and understand your argument

**2. Background: The State of Wage Inequality (1 page)**

Using the exhibits, describe:
- Overall trends in wage inequality since 1980
- Which workers have fallen behind? Which have pulled ahead?
- The role of education in explaining (or not explaining) wage gaps

**Important:** Reference specific exhibits and numbers. Don't just summarize in vague terms.

**3. Analysis: Why Inequality Has Grown (1 page)**

Drawing on course readings and lectures, explain the drivers of rising inequality:
- Skill-biased technological change
- Decline of unions and labor market institutions
- Globalization and trade
- Changes in minimum wage policy
- Other factors you find relevant

**Note:** You must cite at least **2 course readings** in this section.

**4. Policy Recommendations (1 page)**

Recommend **three specific policies** the Department of Labor should prioritize. For each:
- What is the policy?
- Which workers would it help?
- What's the evidence it would work?
- What are potential drawbacks or limitations?

**Possible policy areas** (choose from these or propose others):
- Job training and apprenticeship programs
- Minimum wage increases
- Support for collective bargaining
- Early childhood education
- Community college funding
- Earned Income Tax Credit expansion
- Sectoral employment programs
- Career and technical education

**5. Conclusion (half page)**
- Acknowledge tradeoffs and limitations
- Summarize the case for your top priority

### Format Requirements

- 4 pages maximum (not including references)
- 12pt font, 1-inch margins, single-spaced
- Professional memo header: To, From, Date, Subject
- Include a References section citing course readings and exhibits

| Analysis section | 12 | Draws on course concepts, cites readings, logical explanations |
| Recommendations | 12 | Specific, evidence-based, acknowledges tradeoffs |
| Writing quality | 6 | Professional tone, clear prose, proper formatting |
| **Total** | **75** | |

## Pause Point: Handwritten Reflection

**Attached to your submission, include a handwritten response (photo or scan) to the following prompt:**

> "Which exhibit surprised you most, and why? What did you expect to see that you didn't, or what pattern did you not expect?"

This should be 4-6 sentences in your own handwriting. The purpose is to ensure you've personally engaged with the material.

**Note:** Typed responses to this prompt will not receive credit.

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Lead with findings, not process** - Don't write "In Exhibit 1, I observed..." Write "Wage inequality at the top has grown faster than at the bottom (Exhibit 1)."

2. **Be specific** - "The college premium is about 80%" is better than "College graduates earn more."

3. **Connect evidence to recommendations** - If you recommend job training, explain which workers need it based on the data.

4. **Acknowledge limitations** - No policy is perfect. Showing you understand tradeoffs strengthens your argument.

5. **Write for a busy reader** - Use topic sentences, bullet points where appropriate, and clear structure.
