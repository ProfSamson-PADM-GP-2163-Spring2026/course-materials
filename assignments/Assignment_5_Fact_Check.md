# Assignment 5: Evaluating Labor Policy Claims

**Course:** Labor Policy and the Future of Work
**Connects to:** Week 9 - Technology, Automation, and AI
**Due Date:** [To be determined]
**Points:** 75

---

## Overview

Public discourse about the future of work is filled with dramatic claims: "AI will eliminate 47% of jobs!" "Robots are coming for your job!" "The gig economy is destroying stable employment!" But how do we evaluate these claims? Where do the numbers come from? Are they being used correctly?

This assignment develops your **critical evaluation skills**. You will analyze opinion pieces making empirical claims about labor markets, trace claims to their sources, and assess whether the evidence supports the argument.

**No data analysis required** - this is about reading, researching, and writing.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. Identify empirical claims in policy arguments
2. Trace claims to original sources
3. Evaluate whether evidence is being used accurately
4. Distinguish strong from weak arguments about labor policy
5. Write clear, evidence-based critiques

---

## The Assignment

### Step 1: Select Your Op-Ed

Choose ONE of the following op-eds/articles (available on [course LMS]):

**Option A:** "Robots Will Take Our Jobs" narrative
- An op-ed arguing that automation will cause mass unemployment

**Option B:** "Immigration Hurts American Workers" narrative
- An op-ed arguing that immigration reduces wages and employment for natives

**Option C:** "The Gig Economy is Exploitation" narrative
- An op-ed arguing that gig work (Uber, DoorDash, etc.) is harmful to workers

**Option D:** "The Minimum Wage Kills Jobs" narrative
- An op-ed arguing against minimum wage increases

Each option includes a 1-2 page opinion piece from a major publication.

---

## Part 1: Identify the Claims (15 points)

Read your selected op-ed carefully and identify **three specific empirical claims** the author makes.

For each claim, fill in this template:

### Claim 1:
**The claim:** [Quote or paraphrase the specific claim]

**Type of claim:** [Check one]
- [ ] A specific number or statistic (e.g., "47% of jobs...")
- [ ] A causal claim (e.g., "X causes Y")
- [ ] A trend claim (e.g., "X is increasing/decreasing")
- [ ] A comparison (e.g., "X is more than Y")

**Source cited by author:** [What source, if any, does the author provide?]

**How important is this claim to the argument?** [Central / Supporting / Minor]

[Repeat for Claims 2 and 3]

---

## Part 2: Source Investigation (25 points)

For EACH of your three claims, investigate the original source.

### Investigation Template (complete for each claim):

**Claim:** [Restate the claim]

**Source found:**
- Full citation (author, title, year, publication)
- URL or DOI if available

**What the source actually says:**
- Quote the relevant passage from the original source
- Is this peer-reviewed research, a think tank report, a government statistic, or something else?

**Does the op-ed accurately represent the source?**
- [ ] Yes, accurately represented
- [ ] Partially accurate but missing context
- [ ] Significantly misrepresented
- [ ] Could not verify (source not provided or not findable)

**Explain:** [1-2 sentences explaining your assessment]

**What context is missing?**
[Are there caveats, limitations, or opposing findings the op-ed doesn't mention?]

---

## Part 3: Evaluation Essay (35 points)

Write a **3-page evaluation essay** assessing the overall quality of the op-ed's argument.

### Required Sections:

**1. Summary (half page)**
- What is the author's main argument?
- What action or policy is the author advocating for (or against)?

**2. Strength of Evidence (1 page)**

For each of your three claims, assess:
- Is the claim supported by the cited evidence?
- Are there important caveats the author ignores?
- Does the author conflate correlation with causation?
- Are there alternative interpretations of the evidence?

**3. What's Missing? (half page)**

Drawing on course materials, identify:
- Evidence or perspectives the author ignores
- Counterarguments the author doesn't address
- Relevant research that complicates the author's narrative

Cite at least **one course reading** that provides a different perspective.

**4. Overall Assessment (half page)**

Rate the argument on a scale from 1-5:
- **5 = Very strong:** Claims are accurate, evidence is solid, counterarguments addressed
- **4 = Mostly strong:** Minor issues but overall reliable
- **3 = Mixed:** Some accurate claims, some problems
- **2 = Weak:** Significant misrepresentations or missing context
- **1 = Very weak:** Major factual errors or misleading use of evidence

Explain your rating.

**5. How would you make the argument better? (half page)**

If you agree with the author's position:
- What evidence should they have included?
- What counterarguments should they have addressed?

If you disagree with the author's position:
- What's the strongest version of the opposing argument?
- What evidence would you cite?

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Part 1: Claim identification | 15 | Three clear claims identified, correctly categorized |
| Part 2: Source investigation | 25 | Genuine effort to find sources, accurate assessment of representation |
| Summary | 5 | Accurate, concise summary of the argument |
| Strength of evidence | 15 | Thoughtful evaluation, identifies problems and strengths |
| What's missing | 10 | Cites course readings, identifies relevant counterarguments |

## Pause Point: Source Documentation

**Before the final due date, submit a "Source Log" showing your research process:**

| Claim | Search terms used | Sources consulted | Source selected |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

Also include:
- Screenshots of at least 2 sources you consulted (can be partial screenshots)
- 1-2 sentences per claim explaining how you found the source

**Purpose:** This documents your research process and ensures you're doing the investigation yourself, not just accepting the author's characterization.

**Due:** [One week before final submission]

## Research Tips

### Finding Original Sources

1. **Look for citations** - Check footnotes, hyperlinks, or author mentions
2. **Google Scholar** - Search the claim + author names mentioned
3. **Think tank websites** - If author cites "Brookings" or "Heritage," go to their site
4. **Government data** - Claims about jobs/wages often cite BLS, Census, or CBO
5. **NBER working papers** - Academic studies are often published here first

### Common Problems to Look For

- **Cherry-picking:** Citing one study while ignoring many that disagree
- **Outdated sources:** Using old data that's been superseded
- **Misreading:** Getting the number right but the interpretation wrong
- **Correlation vs. causation:** Assuming X causes Y just because they move together
- **Missing context:** Citing a number without explaining limitations
- **Generalization:** Extrapolating from one case to the whole economy

### Red Flags

- No sources cited at all
- Vague attribution ("studies show," "economists agree")
- Sources that don't actually say what the author claims
- Only citing sources from one ideological perspective

## Example Evaluation (Abbreviated)

**Claim:** "Automation will eliminate 47% of American jobs in the next two decades."

**Source investigation:** This claim comes from Frey & Osborne (2013), an Oxford study. The original paper says 47% of jobs are *susceptible* to automation, not that they *will* be automated. The authors explicitly note that many factors (regulation, wages, social acceptance) affect whether automation actually occurs.

**Assessment:** Partially accurate but missing context. The op-ed presents a worst-case scenario as inevitable, ignoring the original authors' caveats and subsequent research showing lower estimates.

## Reflection Question

Be prepared to discuss in class:

> "Why do misleading claims about labor markets spread so easily in public discourse? What makes some narratives more appealing than accurate but complicated explanations?"
