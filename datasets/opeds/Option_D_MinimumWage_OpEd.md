# Option D: The $15 Minimum Wage Will Destroy Jobs

The push for a $15 federal minimum wage has become an article of faith among progressives. Who could oppose giving low-wage workers a raise? But good intentions don't repeal the laws of economics. A $15 minimum wage would be a disaster for the very workers it claims to help.

The basic economics are inescapable: when you raise the price of something, people buy less of it. Labor is no exception. **The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a $15 federal minimum wage would eliminate 1.4 million jobs**. That's not a projection from some industry-funded think tank—it's the nonpartisan CBO, the gold standard of economic analysis in Washington.

For workers who keep their jobs, a higher minimum wage is a windfall. But what about the 1.4 million who lose theirs? For them, the minimum wage isn't $15—it's zero. Telling an unemployed teenager that you've raised the minimum wage is cold comfort when no one will hire them.

The damage is concentrated among those least able to bear it. **Young workers ages 16-24 would account for half of all job losses** from a $15 minimum wage, according to CBO projections. These are the entry-level positions that help young people gain the skills and experience they need to climb the economic ladder. Kick out the bottom rung, and many will never get on the ladder at all.

Small businesses would bear the brunt of the impact. Unlike large corporations, small businesses operate on thin margins and can't easily absorb a doubling of labor costs. A survey by the National Federation of Independent Business found that **92% of small business owners oppose a $15 federal minimum wage**, and **half say they would be forced to lay off employees**.

We don't need to speculate about these effects—we can observe them in cities that have already raised their minimum wages. When Seattle implemented its $15 minimum wage, researchers at the University of Washington found that **hours worked fell so sharply that low-wage workers actually earned $125 less per month** despite the higher hourly rate. The wage increase turned into an income decrease.

New York's experience tells a similar story. After the state began phasing in a $15 minimum wage, **restaurant employment in New York City fell by 4.7%** while it continued growing in the rest of the state. The hospitality industry—precisely the sector minimum wage advocates claim to be helping—has been devastated.

The employment losses fall disproportionately on minority workers. Economists have consistently found that **minimum wage increases have the largest negative employment effects on Black teenagers**, who already face the highest unemployment rates of any demographic group. A policy designed to reduce inequality ends up entrenching it.

Some economists point to studies showing minimal employment effects from past minimum wage increases. But those studies examined modest increases during periods of economic growth. A $15 federal minimum wage is something else entirely—it would **more than double the current minimum wage in states like Mississippi, where the median wage is just $17 per hour**. You cannot extrapolate from a 5% increase to a 100% increase.

Proponents argue that higher wages will be offset by reduced turnover, increased productivity, and higher consumer spending. These benefits are real but modest. They cannot explain away a labor cost increase of 107%. Something has to give—and that something is jobs.

There are better ways to help low-wage workers: expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, improving job training, making childcare affordable. These approaches boost incomes without destroying employment. A $15 minimum wage sounds compassionate, but its real-world consequences are anything but.
