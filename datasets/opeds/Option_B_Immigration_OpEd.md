# Option B: The Hidden Cost of Mass Immigration

For decades, economists assured us that immigration was an unambiguous good for the American economy. More workers meant more growth, they said. The evidence, we were told, was overwhelming. But a growing body of research tells a different story—one that establishment economists have been reluctant to acknowledge.

The uncomfortable truth is that mass immigration has been devastating for American workers, particularly those without college degrees. When employers have access to an unlimited supply of foreign labor willing to work for less, it's American workers who pay the price.

Harvard economist George Borjas, one of the few scholars willing to challenge the consensus, has documented the damage. His research shows that **immigration between 1980 and 2000 reduced wages for American workers without a high school diploma by 7.4%**. That's not a rounding error—it's thousands of dollars taken from the paychecks of America's most vulnerable workers every year.

The scale of immigration makes these effects impossible to ignore. Today, **over 45 million people living in the United States were born in another country**—more than the entire population of Canada. In key industries, foreign-born workers now dominate. **In construction, over 30% of workers are immigrants.** In agriculture, the figure approaches 50%. American workers in these industries have seen their bargaining power collapse.

Proponents of high immigration often point to studies showing minimal wage effects. But these studies typically use flawed methodologies that obscure the true impact. They compare cities with different immigrant populations, ignoring that American workers move away from areas flooded with immigrant labor. When you account for this "native flight," as Borjas has shown, **the negative wage effects are three to four times larger** than the optimistic estimates suggest.

The impact extends beyond wages to employment itself. **For every 10% increase in immigrant workers in an occupation, native employment in that occupation falls by 5%**. Americans aren't choosing to leave these jobs—they're being pushed out by employers who prefer a more compliant, lower-wage workforce.

Consider the meatpacking industry. A generation ago, these were good union jobs paying middle-class wages. Today, after decades of deliberate recruitment of immigrant labor, **wages in meatpacking have fallen 45% in real terms**. The workers who once supported families in small-town America have been replaced by a rotating cast of immigrants living in overcrowded housing.

Some argue that immigrants "do jobs Americans won't do." This is exactly backwards. Americans won't do these jobs *at the wages employers are offering*—wages that have been suppressed by decades of labor oversupply. In tight labor markets, employers raise wages and improve conditions. Mass immigration ensures the labor market is never tight.

The tech industry tells a similar story. The H-1B visa program was sold as a way to fill genuine skill shortages. Instead, it's become a tool for replacing American workers with cheaper foreign alternatives. **Major corporations have laid off thousands of American tech workers while simultaneously requesting more H-1B visas.** Studies show that H-1B workers earn 20-25% less than comparable American workers.

Economists who dismiss these concerns are often the same people who correctly worry about other threats to worker bargaining power—declining unions, the rise of monopsony employers, the weakening of labor standards. Why is it forbidden to notice that flooding the labor market also harms workers?

It's time for an honest conversation about immigration policy—one that puts American workers first.
